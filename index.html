      <p>üëã Hustlers,</p>

      <p>After spending 30+ years combined in the industry and working for multiple startups in different roles,
        Vishwesh
        and
        Akshay decided to come together and start <b>Sifar Ventures</b>. Why are we calling it Sifar? <a href="https://www.sifar.vc">Read it here</a> 
          Why together? We understand and complement each other very well, and we value our
          friendship a lot.
          We bring in a unique blend of technology, product, and people‚Äôs perspective while working together. We are
          also a
          people magnet. We aim to bring in the best of the people together under the <b>Sifar Ventures</b> umbrella to help
          founders in their journey.
          
        Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshaymdeo/">Akshay</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishweshji/">Vishwesh</a>.</p>

      <p>At <b>Sifar Ventures</b>, we are on a mission to help startup founders, hustlers, from day 0 (Sifar). We want to
        become
        part of their journey right from discovery, validation, technology choices, building initial MVP, raising
        funds,
        hiring the right people to help them find the right product-market fit, and scaling further. We would get
        involved
        at every stage with the founders, stay hands-on, and if we cannot do it ourselves, we will make the right
        connections to enable founders to find the answers.</p>

      <p>At <b>Sifar Ventures</b>, our goal is to practice thematic early-stage investing with a focus on solving global
        problems
        and providing highly active, hands-on support to founders. We have been investing in startups in an individual
        capacity and via various syndicates on angel.co. And now, we are setting on a journey to build our team of
        like-minded investors. We are not just focusing on the ‚Äúdeal-flow‚Äù but concentrating on the domain, problem,
        technology, and, most notably, people/founders. So we would like to invest in what we understand and believe
        in:
        SaaS, fintech, edtech, deeptech, consumer tech, e-commerce, m-commerce, fitness, electric vehicles, etc. We
        are
        okay to miss out on some significant opportunities in sectors which we are not experts in like FMCG, crypto,
        etc.
        Our goal is to add ‚Äúvalue‚Äù beyond investment. Value for us means Empathy to understand founders and listen to
        them
        and be present for them. Value for us means help founders fill the knowledge gaps. Value for us means making
        those
        right connections. Value for us means building trust, and trust means quality delivered consistently.
        Here is a peak in our current portfolio.</p>

      <p>In our career and life, we have always invested in people more than products. We are what we are because of
        the
        people who trusted us, worked with us, and invested in us. Industry leaders like <a href="https://redpoint.com/author/s-dharmaraj/">Satish Dharmaraj</a> (investor in
        Acompli, Astro), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinhenrikson/">Kevin Henrikson</a> (Founder Acompli), who trusted us, and helped
          us
          gain some fantastic experience in our career and life inspire us a lot. We are merely passing it on,
          becoming
          enablers for future founders. We are here to build relationships that last far beyond investment.</p>

      <p>As lead investors of <b>Sifar Ventures</b>, we promise to always work from the realm of trust and integrity.</p>
